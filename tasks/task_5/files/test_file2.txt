Testament of Youth is a memoir of British nurse and activist Vera Brittain 
(1893–1970), published in 1933. Brittain's memoir covers the years 1900 to 1925, 
and continues with Testament of Experience, published in 1957, and encompassing 
the years 1925 to 1950. Between these two books comes Testament of Friendship 
(published in 1940), which is essentially a memoir of Brittain's close colleague 
and friend Winifred Holtby. A final segment of memoir, to be called Testament 
of Faith or Testament of Time, was planned by Brittain but remained unfinished at 
her death.
Testament of Youth has been acclaimed as a classic for its description of the 
impact of World War I on the lives of women and the middle-class civilian 
population of the United Kingdom. The book shows how the impact extended into 
the postwar years. It is also considered a classic in feminist literature for 
its depiction of a woman's pioneering struggle to forge an independent career 
in a society only grudgingly tolerant of educated women.[1]
